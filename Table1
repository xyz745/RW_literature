Canedo et al. [S1] examined the effects of WFH on the personal and professional lives of ICT practitioners, taking into account gender disparities during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Their study found that women are underrepresented in leadership positions and revealed that only 30.37% of women hold leadership positions in the project they participate in, with a majority of chief information officers being men, that shows the ’broken rung’ phenomena in the software industry. Arntz et al. [S2] analyzed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, taking into account gender differences and various factors, such as the diverse work arrangements within couples. Russell et al. [S3] outlined the profound impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on various marginalized groups, including individuals in caregiving roles, women, transgender and nonbinary individuals, Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), immigrants and non-native English speakers, as well as people with disabilities. Subsequently, they extrapolate future projections regarding the implications of RW on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) aspects for this particular population, specifically in terms of technology and the workforce. Ibarra et al. [S5] discussed why WFH is not good for women. They highlighted women’s challenges with WFH, including conflicts between work and family responsibilities, limited access to informal networks and critical assignments, and presenteeism bias. Leroy et al. [S4] examined the impact of COVID-19 on women. Their research revealed that in RW environments, women experienced a higher frequency of interruptions compared to men, and the burden of interruptions was not evenly distributed between genders. Consequently, the study concluded that COVID-19 has exacerbated gender inequalities in the workplace. Additionally, their supplementary analyses demonstrated that women were less likely to have access to a dedicated workspace that was not shared with others. The 2023 Global Report [S6] "Deloitte: Women at Work" featured responses from 5,000 women across 10 countries, highlighted the various challenges such as burnout, microaggression women faced at RW environment.
